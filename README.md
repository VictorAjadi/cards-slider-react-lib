# Details
# Dynamic Screen Size Handling
The component dynamically adjusts the number of cards displayed based on the screen size. It uses breakpoints to define the number of cards per view:

# Extra Small: 
1 card
# Small:
2 cards
# Medium:
3 cards
# Large:
4 cards
# Auto Arrangement
The autoArrange prop ensures that the cards are rearranged dynamically as the user navigates through the carousel. This provides a smooth and continuous sliding experience.

# Navigation Buttons
The component includes "next" and "previous" buttons for navigating through the cards. The button color can be customized using the buttonColor prop.
